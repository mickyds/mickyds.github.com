            <p>What are you talkin' about, Doc?! There's no point in denying it. I'm in love with Clara. Oh man. Doc, we don't belong here! Neither one of us! You know it could still be you that gets shot tomorrow! (He takes out the photograph of the tombstone from his pocket and shoves it in Doc's face.) This tombstone could still be in your future! Marty...the future isn't written. It can be changed; you know that! Anyone can make their future whatever they want it to be. I can't let this one little photograph determine my entire destiny. I have to live my life according to what I believe is right... in my heart. (sighs) Doc...you're a scientist. So you tell me. What's the right thing to do, up here?? (he points to his head.)Yeah, they ought to tear this whole place down. (The officers press Jennifer's thumb to a panel next to the front door, and it opens.) (v.o) Welcome home Jennifer. (Jennifer is beginning to wake up.) What? He's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you. (Doc's House) (Instead of living in his small workshop, Doc now lives in a very large house. Marty knocks on the door. As he turns his back, waiting for Doc to answer the door, the door opens a crack and Doc peaks out. When Marty turns Doc slams the door shut.) Doc? (Doc opens the door fully now. He's got some strange contraption on his head. He pulls Marty into the living room.)Will you take care of that? Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. (he takes a drink and then goes over to Lorraine's table.) Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. What? Oh, what I meant to day was… Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?</p>
