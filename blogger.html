    <p class="blogone">(w.t) I'll be there. (Hallway) (1985 Marty exits through the door. 1955 Marty exits, but sees Lorraine before he gets to the door.) Lorraine! Marty, that was very interesting music. (1985 Marty watches this through the door.) I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.(Clara jerks back and kicks Tannen hard in the shins. He cringes in pain and Clara backs up. The music dies and everyone stops dancing at this turn of events. Doc gets free.) Stop it! Damn you, Tannen! No, I damn you. (He draws his gun and aims at Doc. Marty sees what's going on from his vantage point at the banquet table. He grabs the Frisbee plate.) I damn you to hell!(At the very same moment that Tannen fires his gun Marty throws the plate. It deflects the bullet and it shoots off Doc's hat instead. Doc is very stunned. Tannen whips around to see who's stopped him from shooting Doc.) You! Hey, lighten up, jerk! (Tannen turns to his gang members, who shrug in response.) Mighty strong words, runt! You man enough to back that up with more than just a pie plate?!(They slam the trunk shut and one of the band members gets out of the car.) What the hell you doing to my car? Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you. Who are you calling spook, pecker-wood. Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay? (they run off)Something that really cooks. (to audience) Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. (to band) Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. (they begin to play 'Johnny Be Good') Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going. George you ever think of running for class president? (Marvin goes backstage and makes a phone call.) (into phone) John, John, its' your cousin. Your cousin Marvin Barry, you know that new sound you're lookin for, well listen to this.Doc'I can't tell you. It might make things worse. Wait a minute, Doc...what is wrong with my future?! Calmly. Marty...we all have to make decisions that affect the course of our lives. You've gotta do what you've gotta do. And I've gotta do what I've gotta do. (leaves) (Railroad Tracks - Night) (Marty is working on something when Doc walks over and stoops down to talk to him.)
