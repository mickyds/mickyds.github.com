Hey, look, pal, I don't want to buy a suit!(w.t) I'll grab it as soon as we get to the school. (Courthouse Square) (w.t) Marty! You must be extremely careful not to run into your other self. (1955 Doc appears. He makes some adjustments to his "weather experiment." Neither Doc sees the other.) (v.o) My other self?(School – The Dance) (w.t) Listen Doc, Biff's guys chased me into the gym and they're gonna jump...me! (DeLorean) (w.t) Then get out of there! (v.o) No Doc, not me, the other me, the one's that's up on stage playing Johnny B Goode!Kid, I own the police! Besides, they couldn't match up the bullet that killed your old man. You son of a bitch! I suppose it's poetic justice - two McFlys with the same gun. (Looking down again, Marty jumps off the roof. Biff looks at him with a "what the hell?" look and approaches the roof. He chuckles to himself. Then he sees Marty hovering in mid-air! It turns out that he's standing on the DeLorean.) (DeLorean) What the hell?(Marty puts the hoverboard in the DeLorean and says hi to Einstein again.) Hi Einie, hi buddy! (He picks up the almanac in its bag, but the book falls out and lands at Doc's feet.) What's this? Uh, it's a souvenir... 50 years of Sports Statistics. Hardly recreational reading material Marty.</p>
