Hey, look, pal, I don't want to buy a suit!(w.t) I'll grab it as soon as we get to the school. (Courthouse Square) (w.t) Marty! You must be extremely careful not to run into your other self. (1955 Doc appears. He makes some adjustments to his "weather experiment." Neither Doc sees the other.) (v.o) My other self?(School – The Dance) (w.t) Listen Doc, Biff's guys chased me into the gym and they're gonna jump...me! (DeLorean) (w.t) Then get out of there! (v.o) No Doc, not me, the other me, the one's that's up on stage playing Johnny B Goode!Kid, I own the police! Besides, they couldn't match up the bullet that killed your old man. You son of a bitch! I suppose it's poetic justice - two McFlys with the same gun. (Looking down again, Marty jumps off the roof. Biff looks at him with a "what the hell?" look and approaches the roof. He chuckles to himself. Then he sees Marty hovering in mid-air! It turns out that he's standing on the DeLorean.) (DeLorean) What the hell?(Marty puts the hoverboard in the DeLorean and says hi to Einstein again.) Hi Einie, hi buddy! (He picks up the almanac in its bag, but the book falls out and lands at Doc's feet.) What's this? Uh, it's a souvenir... 50 years of Sports Statistics. Hardly recreational reading material Marty. Yeah, was it a big wedding? (to Marty) Marty, we'll be able to see our wedding! Wow. I'll be able to see my wedding dress. Wow. I wonder where we live, I bet its a big house, with lots of kids. How many kids...Marty Jr.Um, yeah Griff, you know, I was thinking about it and I'm not sure it's a good idea because I just think it might just be a little bit dangerous. (Spike feels Marty Jr.'s face with her finger. Marty Jr. groans a bit.) What's wrong McFly? You got no scrote? (She moves her hand so it digs into Marty Junior's “private area”.) Marty Jr.Ooh! (He falls on the counter, and Griff's gang laugh. Marty is visible in this shot, although no-one sees him.)(modestly) No, hey, ma'am. Had you not interceded, Emmett might have been shot! Marty...uh, Clint...I'm going to take Clara home. (Before Marty can reply he's pulled aside by another man.) You sure set him straight, Mr. Eastwood. I'm glad somebody finally got the gumption to stand up to that son-of-a-bitch.(moves off) Well, I guess Miss Clayton will have to find other transportation. Turning to face Marty. If I never meet the woman, there's no possibility of a romantic infatuation, right? You're the doc, Doc. Alright then. Let's get the Delorean and get ourselves back to the future! (casually) Oh Doc, I tore a hole in the gas tank. We'll have to patch it up and get gas. (Freezes in place) You mean we're out of gas?</p>
